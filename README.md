# SwaggerAPIAspNetCore
Swagger, also known as OpenAPI provides API discoverability. This is a basic example of how to integrate it to AspNetCore API project in Visual Studio 2019.

.NET core 3.0

Swashbuckle.AspNetCore 5.0.0-rc4
- Install-Package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore

I referred [this](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/web-api-documentation-using-swagger-and-asp-net-core-with-visual-studio-2019/) documentation when creating this.
